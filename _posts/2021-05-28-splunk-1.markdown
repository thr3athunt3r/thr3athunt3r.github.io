#### Have you ever wonder to forward windows event logs to a Splunk instance without need of mass deploying [universal forwarder](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Universalforwarder) on every single host? This might be a solution for you! What we're gonna do is centralize all the logs first with [Windows Event Collector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wec/windows-event-collector), then forward them with just a universal forwarder which will also be installed on the same server. So, let's get started.

### Prerequisite:
1. **Windows Event Forwarding Server**
    - Windows Server 2012 and above (or Windows 10, extra configuration is required)
    - 16GB of RAM or more for 2000 clients
    - CPU with 4 or more core for 2000 clients
    - Log size for each client is about 700MB per day with advanced audit configured (log ingested to Splunk won't be so big)
    - SSD is recommended
    <br><br>
2. **Client(s)**
    - Windows 7 and above (lower versions are not tested)
    - Windows Server 2012 and above (lower versions are not tested)
    <br><br>

### Step 1: Setup Source Initiated Subscription for Windows Event Forwarding
1. **Configure GPO**    
    - Allow `network access` to Security Events on all clients
    > Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Windows Components --> Event Log Service --> Security --> Configure Log Access --> Enabled --> O:BAG:SYD:(A;;0xf0005;;;SY)(A;;0x5;;;BA)(A;;0x1;;;S-1-5-32-573)(A;;0x1;;;NS)
    - Enable WinRM on both WEF server and clients (ensure WinRM is set up in best practice)
    > Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Windows Components --> Windows Remote Management (WinRM) --> WinRM Service --> Enabled
    - Enable event forwarding subscription for all clients
    > Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Windows Components --> Event Forwarding --> Configure Target Subscription Manager --> Enabled --> Server=http://<FQDN>:5985/wsman/SubscriptionManager/WEC,Refresh=60
2. **Create a Windows Event Forwarding Subscription**
    > Event Viewer --> Subscriptions --> Create Subscription --> Source initiated --> (Your Preferences) --> Apply --> OK <br>

    > Application,<br> 
    > Security,<br> 
    > Setup,<br> 
    > System,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/EXE and DLL,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/MSI and Script,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/Packaged app-Deployment,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-AppLocker/Packaged app-Execution,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Admin,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-RemoteDesktopServices-RdpCoreTS/Admin,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-RemoteDesktopServices-RdpCoreTS/Operational,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-SMBClient/Security,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Maintenance,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Admin,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-LocalSessionManager/Operational,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager/Admin,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager/Operational,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-Windows Remote Management/Operational,<br> 
    > Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational,<br> 
    > Windows PowerShell<br> 
    > 19-21,576-578,1102,4104,4624,4625,4648,4672,4688,4697-4699,4700-4702,4722,4738,4740,4768,4769,4776-4779,5140,5145


### Step 2: Configure Splunk Indexer Prepare to Receive Logs from Windows Event Forwarding Server
1. **Log on to your Splunk Indexer**
2. **Configure listen port on `9997`(can be any unused port)**
    > Settings --> Forwarding and receiving --> Configure receiving --> New Receiving Port --> 9997

3. **The port now should be `enabled`**

### Step 3: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows Event Forwarding Server
1. **Get to your Windows Event Forwarding Server**
2. **Download and install Splunk Universal Forwarder [here](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/universal-forwarder.html)**
3. **During installation, either `Local System`, `Domain Account`, or `Virtual Account` will work, it requires local administrator rights to access those logs**
4. **You need at least select all the `Windows Event Logs` types for it to works**
5. **In my environment, I don't use `Deployment Server` so I'll just configure `Receiving Indexer` port as `9997` that we set on previous step**
6. **Once the installation is completed, Splunk Universal Forwarder will start forwarding the event logs to your indexer automatically**

### Final Step: Check Your Splunk Data Ingestion
1. **Return to your Splunk Indexer**
2. **Use the `Search & Reporting` app to ensure your `Windows Event Logs` are being ingested**
